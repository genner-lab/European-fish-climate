Mean CPUE for 5 year periods for separate surveys at a 1 degree longitude x 1 degree latitude scale. Source data are	detailed in Supplementary Table 1 of the paper

Survey names (Supplementary Table 1 of the paper) followed by the months included in each separated survey for analysis, first letter of each month where A = April, Au = August.

demidec	= Half decade over which mean data was calculated, denoted with a sequential letter for each 5 year window, followed by the years included, separated by '_'. From 83–99 are from 20th century (1900's). From 00–18 are from 21st century (2000's)

gridcell = Latitude and longitude at the centre of whole 1 degreex1degree gridcells over which data were aggregated.
valid_name	Accepted species name from https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=126436 

mean_demidec_sp_survey_4thrt = 4th root of the mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of species in the survey in the 1 degree latitude x 1 degree longitude cell, calculated from the recorded CPUE per haul.

mean_demidec_sp_survey_CPHE_pure = Mean CPUE of species in the survey in the 1 degree latitude x 1 degree longitude cell, calculated from the recorded CPUE per haul.

n_haul_demidec = Number of hauls in the 1 degree latitude x 1 degree longitude cell for the survey.
